### title: Ordering-based Conditions for Global Convergence of Policy Gradient Methods
### Relevence Score：5
### abstract
We prove that, for finite-arm bandits with linear function approximation, the global convergence of policy gradient (PG) methods depends on inter-related properties between the policy update and the representation. \textcolor{blue}{First}, we establish a few key observations that frame the study: \textbf{(i)} Global convergence can be achieved under linear function approximation without policy or reward realizability, both for the standard Softmax PG and natural policy gradient (NPG). \textbf{(ii)} Approximation error is not a key quantity for characterizing global convergence in either algorithm. \textbf{(iii)} The conditions on the representation that imply global convergence are different between these two algorithms. Overall, these observations call into question approximation error as an appropriate quantity for characterizing the global convergence of PG methods under linear function approximation. \textcolor{blue}{Second}, motivated by these observations, we establish new general results: \textbf{(i)} NPG with linear function approximation achieves global convergence \emph{if and only if} the projection of the reward onto the representable space preserves the optimal action's rank, a quantity that is not strongly related to approximation error. \textbf{(ii)} We show that the global convergence of Softmax PG occurs if the representation can merely preserve the ranking of rewards, a property that goes well beyond policy or reward realizability. We provide experimental results to support these theoretical findings.

### title: Sharpness Minimization Algorithms Do Not Only Minimize Sharpness To Achieve Better Generalization
### Relevence Score: 4
### abstract
The reason why overparameterized neural networks can generalize remains mysterious. Existing proofs show that common stochastic optimizers tend to converge to flat minimizers of training loss, and thus a natural and popular explanation is that flatness implies generalization. This work critically examines this explanation. Through theoretical and empirical investigation, we identify the following three scenarios for two-layer ReLU networks:(1) flatness provably implies generalization; (2) there exist non-generalizing flattest models and sharpness minimization algorithms fail to generalize poorly, and (3) perhaps most strikingly, there exist non-generalizing flattest models, but sharpness minimization algorithms still generalize. Our results suggest that the relationship between sharpness and generalization subtlely depends on the data distributions and the model architectures and sharpness minimization algorithms do not only minimize sharpness to achieve better generalization. This calls for the search for other explanations for the generalization of over-parameterized neural networks.

### title: LeanDojo: Theorem Proving with Retrieval-Augmented Language Models
### Relevence Score: 4
### abstract
Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in proving formal theorems using proof assistants such as Lean. However, existing methods are difficult to reproduce or build on, due to private code, data, and large compute requirements. This has created substantial barriers to research on machine learning methods for theorem proving. This paper removes these barriers by introducing LeanDojo: an open-source Lean playground consisting of toolkits, data, models, and benchmarks. LeanDojo extracts data from Lean and enables interaction with the proof environment programmatically. It contains fine-grained annotations of premises in proofs, providing valuable data for premise selection—a key bottleneck in theorem proving. Using this data, we develop ReProver (Retrieval-Augmented Prover): an LLM-based prover augmented with retrieval for selecting premises from a vast math library. It is inexpensive and needs only one GPU week of training. Our retriever leverages LeanDojo's program analysis capability to identify accessible premises and hard negative examples, which makes retrieval much more effective. Furthermore, we construct a new benchmark consisting of 98,641 theorems and proofs extracted from Lean's math library. It features challenging data split requiring the prover to generalize to theorems relying on novel premises that are never used in training. We use this benchmark for training and evaluation, and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ReProver over non-retrieval baselines and GPT-4. We thus provide the first set of open-source LLM-based theorem provers without any proprietary datasets and release it under a permissive MIT license to facilitate further research.

### title: How to Turn Your Knowledge Graph Embeddings into Generative Models via Probabilistic Circuits
### Relevence Score: 6
### abstract
Some of the most successful knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models for link prediction – CP, RESCAL, T UCK ER, C OMPL E X – can be interpreted as energy-based models. Under this perspective they are not amenable for exact maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE), sampling and struggle to integrate logical constraints. This work re-interprets the score functions of these KGEs as circuits – constrained computational graphs allowing efficient marginalisation. Then, we design two recipes to obtain efficient generative circuit models by either restricting their activations to be non-negative or squaring their outputs. Our interpretation comes with little or no loss of performance for link prediction, while the circuits framework unlocks exact learning by MLE, efficient sampling of new triples, and guarantee that logical constraints are satisfied by design. Furthermore, our models scale more gracefully than the original KGEs on graphs with millions of entities.
