## 二、课文英文原文
Dear Mary,
    Today was my first day in England and I learned something interesting about the weather here. It was cold in the morning. The weather report said the temperature was only 15 dregree Celsius, so I put on lots of clothes before I went to my new school. But when I was outside, the weather quickly changed. The clouds went away; the sky turned blue and the sun started to shine. I was so hot! Then at lunchtime I wanted to go to the playground, but the sky was black and it was raining hard. I had no umbrella. I thought, "How can I go home after school?" But when school finished at 3:00 p.m., there was no rain. Now it was very windy and cool. I put on my coat and walked home. So it's really true. In England, you can have four seasons in one day.
Yours,
Wang Jun
