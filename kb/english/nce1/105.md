## Notes on the text
1. Do you want to speak to her? 在这句话中，to speak是动词want的宾语，而这个结构——动词原形前加to——在英文中被称为动词不定式。本课用动词不定式作宾语的例句还有：I want her to come to my office; Tell her to come at once;
Did you want to see me; I want you to type it again等。
2. full of ...，充满了。
3. And here's ...。这里and表示承上启下，使上下文紧密联系，当“于是”，“因此”讲。
