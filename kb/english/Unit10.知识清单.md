We all know Chinese and Western food is often very different. Chinese people like eating rice or noodles, but Western people eat bread. Chinese people use chopsticks and bowls but in the West, people usually eat their meals on a plate with a knife and fork.

But do you know that people in China have different tastes, too? People from Guangzhou, for example, enjoy sweet and sour food most. They also eat plenty of delicious dimsum. In Beijing, people eat more noodles, pancakes and dumplings. They also like salty food. People from Sichuan love hot food. Some people think it's too hot and tastes terrible. But I love Sichuan food!
